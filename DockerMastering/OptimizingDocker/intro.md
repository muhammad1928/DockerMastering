## Optimizing Docker Images with Multi-Stage Builds

Multi-stage builds in Docker allow you to optimize Docker images by reducing their size and improving efficiency. This is particularly useful when you have a build process that requires tools and dependencies not needed in the final application, allowing you to copy only the necessary artifacts into a final, minimal image.

## Why Multi-Stage Builds are Important
- Reduced Image Size: By including only the final application and its direct dependencies, multi-stage builds reduce the image size significantly, improving download times and disk space usage.
- Enhanced Security: Smaller images with fewer tools and dependencies reduce the attack surface, as unnecessary files and build tools are excluded from the final image.
- Better Performance: Lightweight images can start up and run faster, which is crucial for scaling applications in production environments.
- Streamlined Workflow: Multi-stage builds let you manage complex build processes in a single Dockerfile, making it easier to understand and maintain.



## Step-by-Step Guide to Using Multi-Stage Builds
Let’s walk through a practical example of using multi-stage builds to create a lightweight image for a simple Node.js application. In this example, you’ll compile the app in a larger image and then copy only the built app into a minimal runtime image.


## 1. Create Your Project Directory

Start by making a new directory for your project and navigating into it
```bash
mkdir node-multi-stage
cd node-multi-stage
```

## 2. Create a Simple Node.js Application

Create a ``` server.js``` file
```bash 
nano server.js
```
Add the following basic Node.js server code:
```bash 

const http = require('http');

const hostname = '0.0.0.0';
const port = 3000;

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.statusCode = 200;
    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
    res.end('Hello, Docker Multi-Stage Build!\n');
});

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
    console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});
```
Save and close the file


## 3. Create a package.json File
This file will list the project’s dependencies. Create it in the same directory

```bash 
nano package.json
```

Add the following contents to the file
```bash
{
  "name": "node-multi-stage-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A simple Node.js app for multi-stage Docker build example",
  "main": "server.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1"
  }
}
```
Save and close the file


## 4. Write the Dockerfile with Multi-Stage Builds
Create a ``` Dockerfile``` in the same directory
```bash 
nano Dockerfile
```

Add the following content
```bash 
# Stage 1: Build the application
FROM node:18 as build

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and install dependencies
COPY package.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Stage 2: Run the application in a smaller image
FROM node:18-slim

# Copy only the necessary files from the build stage
COPY --from=build /app /app

# Set the working directory in the runtime container
WORKDIR /app

# Expose the application port
EXPOSE 3000

# Define the command to run the application
CMD ["npm", "start"]

```

### Two stages
This Dockerfile has two stages
- Build Stage: The first stage (build) uses a full Node.js image to install dependencies and copy the application files. All the unnecessary build dependencies and intermediate files are confined to this stage.
- Final Stage: The second stage (node:18-slim) is a lightweight image that contains only the runtime environment. The final image copies only the application from the build stage, without any additional build tools or files.



## 5. Build the Multi-Stage Docker Image

Now, you’ll build the Docker image. Run the following command
```bash 
docker build -t node-multi-stage-app .
```
Docker will process each stage in the Dockerfile. When it finishes, the image will be built with only the necessary files from the final stage.


## 6. Run the Docker Container

Start a container from the optimized image
```bash 
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name my_node_app node-multi-stage-app
```
This command maps port 3000 on your host machine to port 3000 in the container, allowing you to access the app from ``` http://localhost:3000```


## 7. Test the Application

Open a web browser or use ``` curl``` to verify that the application is running
```bash 
curl http://localhost:3000
```
You should see the output: ``` Hello, Docker Multi-Stage Build!```


## 8. Check the Image Size

List your Docker images to compare the size of your multi-stage build image
```bash 
docker images
```
You’ll notice that the ``` node-multi-stage-app``` image is much smaller than it would have been if it included all the build dependencies.


## 9. Clean Up

To remove the container and the image after testing
```bash 
docker stop my_node_app
docker rm my_node_app
docker rmi node-multi-stage-app
```



### Benefits of Multi-Stage Builds
- Efficient Use of Resources: By copying only the necessary files from the build stage, you’re creating a more efficient image that runs faster and uses fewer resources.
- Minimizing Attack Surface: With fewer packages and files in the final image, there are fewer potential vulnerabilities, making it easier to secure your application.
- Streamlined Build Process: You can consolidate multiple build steps within a single Dockerfile, which makes the process easier to maintain and automate.
- Better for CI/CD: Smaller images are faster to pull and deploy, which is especially important for CI/CD pipelines and production environments where speed is essential.
