#### Building and Running a Basic Docker Container

## How to create build and run docker

Start by creating a new directory for Docker 

```bash
mkdir hello-docker
```
Now that you have created the folder, lets navigate to it
```bash
cd hello-docker
```

click on the ```Check``` button to verify that everything is correctly executed
<!-- 
# 6. Test the docker
To check if the container is running, list all running containers
```bash 
docker ps
```

You should see ``` my-nginx-container``` in the list.
Open a web browser and go to ``` http://localhost:8080```. You should see the content from your ``` index.html``` file displayed. If you’re running this on a server, use the server’s IP address instead.


# 7. Stop and Remove the Container

To stop the container, use the following command
```bash 
docker stop my-nginx-container
```
To remove the container after stopping it:
```bash 
docker rm my-nginx-container
```
To clean up the image
```bash 
docker rmi my-nginx-image
```
And that’s it! You’ve successfully created a Dockerfile, built a Docker image, ran it as a container, and verified it was working. This process gives you a solid foundation for understanding how Docker images and containers work. Let me know if you have any questions or need further details!
