## Create the HTML File with "Hello, World!" Content

Next, you will need to create an html file but for this step we made it automatically create for u.

First you need to make the script executable by typing this in terminal
```bash
chmod +x step3-setup.sh
```

Second, you will need to run the script by typing this in the terminal.
```bash
./setup_index.sh
```

The automatically created script will look like this
```bash
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Hello World</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first Docker container!</p>
</body>
</html>
```

click on the ```Check``` button to verify that everything is correctly executed
