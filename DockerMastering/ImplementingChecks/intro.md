## Implementing Health Checks for Containers

## Why Data Persistence is Important
Data persistence is crucial in applications for several reasons:

- Data Retention: It ensures that data is not lost when the application is restarted or the system is shut down.
- Data Sharing: Persistent data can be shared across multiple containers or instances of an application.
- Data Backup and Recovery: Persistent data can be backed up and restored in case of system failures or data corruption.
- Data Integration: It allows for integration with external data sources and systems.
