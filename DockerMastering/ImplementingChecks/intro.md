# Implementing Health Checks for Containers

Implementing health checks for Docker containers is crucial for maintaining the reliability and stability of your applications. Health checks allow Docker to monitor the status of containers and ensure that they are running as expected. If a container fails its health check, Docker can automatically restart it or take other actions, enhancing the resilience of your applications.


## Why Implement Health Checks?

- Automatic Recovery: Health checks allow Docker to restart containers that are not functioning properly, reducing downtime.
- Improved Monitoring: By defining health checks, you gain insights into the running state of your applications.
- Simplified Management: Health checks can automate responses to failures, making it easier to manage complex systems.



## 1. Create a Simple Application (Create a project directory)

Let's set up a basic web application using Flask that we can monitor. 
```bash 
mkdir healthcheck_app
cd healthcheck_app
```

### Create app.py

```bash 
nano app.py
```
Add the following code
```py 
from flask import Flask
import time

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return 'Hello, the application is running!'

@app.route('/fail')
def fail():
    time.sleep(10)  # Simulate a delay
    return 'This route is not healthy!', 500

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)
```
After this press `CTRL + O and ENTER` to save the python file and `CTRL + X` to exit the python file.

###  Create requirements.txt
```bash 
nano requirements.txt
```
Add the following ( we only need flask)
```txt 
flask
```
After this press `CTRL + O and ENTER` to save the textfile and `CTRL + X` to exit the textfile.


## 2. Create a Dockerfile

Now, create a Dockerfile to define how to build your applicationâ€™s container
```bash 
nano Dockerfile
```

Add the following content
```Dockerfile 
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt 
COPY . .

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```
After this press `CTRL + O and ENTER` to save the dockerfile and `CTRL + X` to exit the dockerfile.

## 3. Define Health Checks in Docker Compose

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to define your application and specify the health check.
```bash 
nano docker-compose.yml
```

Add the following content
```yml
version: "3" 
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:5000/"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 5
```
After this press `CTRL + O and ENTER` to save the yml file and `CTRL + X` to exit the yml.
#### In this configuration:

- The healthcheck section specifies a command that Docker will run to check the health of the container.
- interval: How often to run the check (every 30 seconds).
- timeout: How long to wait for the check to complete (10 seconds).
- retries: How many consecutive failures are needed before considering the container unhealthy (5 retries).


## 4. Build and Run the Application

Build and start the containers
```bash 
docker-compose up --build
```


## 5. Monitor Health Check Status

You can open a new termianl and type
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000
```
to see if the app is responding

After the containers are up, you can monitor the health status of the web service
```bash 
docker ps
```
Look for the `STATUS` column. It should display `healthy` after a few intervals if everything is working fine.

Simulate a Failure: To test the health check, you can simulate a failure by accessing the `/fail` endpoint. You can do this using a web browser or a command line:
```bash 
curl http://localhost:5000/fail
```
After invoking the `/fail` endpoint, Docker will eventually mark the container as unhealthy if the health check fails consistently.


Now when all the steps are done, Click on the `Check` button before running the cleanup. else it will not verify


## 6. Clean Up

Stop and remove the containers
```bash 
docker-compose down
```



## Benefits of Implementing Health Checks
- Automatic Recovery: Health checks enable Docker to restart containers that are not healthy, ensuring high availability.
- Better Debugging: By monitoring health, you can diagnose issues in your application more effectively.
- Improved Reliability: Continuous health checks help ensure that your application remains in a good state, preventing downtime and service interruptions.


Implementing health checks is an essential practice for running reliable and resilient applications with Docker.
