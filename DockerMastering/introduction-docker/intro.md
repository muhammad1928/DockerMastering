# What is Docker?

Docker is a platform that lets you package, distribute, and run applications in isolated environments called **containers**. Containers are lightweight and portable, containing everything needed to run an application, ensuring consistency across different environments.

## Key Concepts of Docker

- **Images**: Templates that define whatâ€™s inside a container.
- **Containers**: Running instances of images that are lightweight and efficient.
- **Dockerfile**: A file containing instructions to build an image.
- **Docker Hub**: A repository to share and find Docker images.
- **Docker Compose**: A tool to manage multi-container applications with a single command.

## Why Use Docker?

- **Consistency** across environments.
- **Simplified** dependency management.
- **Resource efficiency** with lightweight containers.
- **Rapid deployment** for CI/CD.
- **Isolation** for security.
