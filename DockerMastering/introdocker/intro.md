# What is Docker?
Docker is a platform that allows developers to package, distribute, and run applications in isolated environments called containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient, meaning they include everything an application needs to run: code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. Docker simplifies application deployment and ensures consistent behavior across different environments.

## Key Concepts of Docker
1. Images: These are read-only templates that define what’s in a container. Images are built from a set of instructions in a Dockerfile, which outlines how to set up the application environment.

2. Containers: Containers are instances of images. When you run an image, it becomes a container. Containers are lightweight and can be started, stopped, moved, or deleted quickly. Unlike virtual machines, containers share the host system’s kernel, making them more efficient in terms of resource usage.

3. Dockerfile: This is a text file containing commands used to assemble an image. A Dockerfile typically specifies the base image, application code, dependencies, and any configuration needed to run the application.

4. Docker Hub: This is a public repository where you can find thousands of Docker images shared by the community, or publish your own images. It’s a great resource for finding pre-configured images of popular applications like databases, web servers, and development tools.

5, Docker Compose: A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Docker Compose, you can use a YAML file to configure all your application’s services, networks, and volumes, and then launch them with a single command.

## Why Use Docker?
Docker has become an essential tool in modern software development and DevOps for several reasons:

1. Consistency Across Environments: Docker ensures that your application behaves the same on your local machine, staging, and production, minimizing “it works on my machine” issues.
2. Simplified Dependency Management: Since containers include all dependencies, you don’t have to worry about conflicts between different projects or environments.
3. Resource Efficiency: Containers are lightweight and share the host’s kernel, making them more efficient than virtual machines.
4. Rapid Deployment: With Docker, you can quickly deploy, scale, and manage applications. This is especially beneficial for continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
5. Isolation: Containers isolate applications from one another and from the underlying system, reducing security risks.
